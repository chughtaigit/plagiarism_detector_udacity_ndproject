# Plagiarism Project, Machine Learning Deployment

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a plagiarism detector using AWS SageMaker.

This data is a slightly modified version of a dataset created by Paul Clough (Information Studies) and Mark Stevenson (Computer Science), at the University of Sheffield. You can read all about the data collection and corpus, at [their university webpage](https://ir.shef.ac.uk/cloughie/resources/plagiarism_corpus.html).

## Project Overview

This project builds a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. 

This project is broken down into three main notebooks:

**Notebook 1: Data Exploration**
* Load in the corpus of plagiarism text data.
* Explore the existing data features and the data distribution.

**Notebook 2: Feature Engineering**

* Clean and pre-process the text data.
* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.
* Select "good" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.
* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.

**Notebook 3: Train and Deploy Model in SageMaker**

* Upload the train/test feature data to S3.
* Define a binary classification model and a training script.
* Train the model and deploy it using SageMaker.
* Evaluate the deployed classifier.
